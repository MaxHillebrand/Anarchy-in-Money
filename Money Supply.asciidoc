Money Supply and Inflation
==========================

An increase in the stock is caused by an increase in the production of money, and decreased by decay, unrecoverable loss and use in production. Because the market will choose a durable money,footnote:[see chapter on the evolution of money] and because the money itself is not consumed or used up in production, the proportional increase of supply will be quite small.

The question arises, if there exists an optimal quantity of money and how much money should be in supply? Economists argue, whether the supply should move in accordance with population growth, economic growth, volume of trade, velocity of trade, the amount of goods produced or according to demand so to keep a stable purchasing power. Many ignore the possibility of leaving the decision to the free and voluntary market.

Money differs from other goods in one essential attribute and understanding this fundamental truth is important to fathom the complex subject of monetary theory. An increase in the supply of consumption goods, leads to more options and a higher living standard for the individual. With more production goods, more consumption goods can be built, thus further increasing future prosperity. Additional land and other natural resources promise more production and consumption, both in the present and the future.

Consumption goods are used up by consumers; and capital goods are used up to produce more consumption goods. But money is not used up, it is neither a consumption nor a capital good, but rather a SoV, MoE and UoA used to increase the number of possible trading pairs, and decrease the complexity and cost of overall trade. 

If Alice is willing to trade her fish for 3 money units, the price of the fish is 3 money units. A money is the UoA, thus all prices are denominated in this good. The price of money itself, is an array of the exchange ratio of all available goods on the market, thus the purchasing power of money. It represents the amount of goods one money unit can purchase, just like the price of the fish represents the amount of money one fish can be traded for. The price of money is thus the inverse of the price of all available goods. With an increase in the supply of money, and unchanging demand, the price of money will fall, thus the price of all other goods denominated in this money will increase. The opposite is true for a decrease in the quantity of money. 

In the hypothetical construct of helicopter money by John Stuart Mill and David Hume,footnote:[reference needed] each individual will simultaneously receive an equal proportion of new money. Let’s assume that Alice has 50 money units, Bob 30 and Charlie 20, and the total supply instantly doubles to 200. Now Alice has 100 money units, Bob 60 and Charlie 40. Are they now magically twice as rich? Did this increase their purchasing power? Obviously not. Alice still has 50%, Bob 30% and Charlie 20% of the money units and purchasing power in the economy. Only an abundance of goods can increase prosperity, and this is limited by the scarcity of the resources land, labor and capital. Simply increasing the money supply does not bypass economic laws. They might feel more wealthy initially because of the increase in their nominal holdings of money, but soon they will realize, that their percentage of the total quantity of money remais equal. As individuals barter for the price of the exchange following the increase in supply, the demand for all goods will roughly double, which will eventually lead to a doubling, but at least an increase in the price of all goods. The new price is reached when demand is satisfied and new money no longer bids against itself for the goods.
Therefore, while the increase in the supply of money will, as with any other good, lead to a decrease in the price of money, but this does not lead to an increase in the benefit for society. The reason for this is that money itself is not consumed and used up, but used as a durable SoV, MoE and UoA. Other goods are valued for their various ‘real’ utilities that can satisfy desires directly when used up, thus the more goods available, the more needs are being fulfilled. The law, that an increase in the money supply does not lead to an increase in prosperity, arises out of the attributes of a MoE. 

Thus the truth is, that it does not matter what the supply of money is! Any quantity of supply will work just fine, as long as the units can be divided for small transactions. On the free and voluntary market, the individuals will simply adjust the prices to the same degree of purchasing power as before the change in supply. This adjustment process will take a considerable amount of time, effort and cost. Thus, even in this hypothetical construct of helicopter money, changing the money supply is not just useless, but actually spawns unnecessary costs and uncertainty.

However, in the real economy, it is impossible to have an instantaneous increase in the money supply. Some market participants receive the new money before others, the consequences are called Cantillon Effects.footnote:[An Essay on Economic Theory, Richard Cantillon, 1755] Let’s again assume the initial state with Alice 50 money units, Bob 30 and Charlie 20, but the 100 inflated money units go directly and solely to Alice. Alice now controls 75%, Bob 15% and Charlie only 10%. It is logical, that Alice having received the money first, benefits at the expense of Bob and Charlie, because her percentage of the money has risen, while Bob's and Charlie's has declined. Further, Bob and Charlie have not yet adjusted their prices upwards to reflect the delusion of the money supply. Alice purchases some berries from Bob for 10 money units, thus the price per berry increases, which adjusts Bob’s purchasing power upwards, but only to 20%, which is still below the initial equilibrium. If Bob now purchases wood from Charlie for 5 money units, Bob has the advantage of buying the wood for the not yet adjusted price. After the exchange, Charlie will adjust the price accordingly, and his purchasing power is now 12.5%.

Contrarely, if Alice loses 20 money units, her purchasing power decreases to 37.5%, Bob’s increases to 35.7% and Charlie’s increases to 25%. Alice has lost both in the quantity of money units, and in her percentage allocation of the total supply. However, Bob and Charlie have not gained additional units, but as the total supply has deflated, their percentage has increased. Thus, Bob and Charlie gain at the expense of Alice, but this is entirely due to her fault, and with no wrong doing from Bob and Charlie. Alice has to cut her spending and thus suffers the most, Bob and Charlie see their buying prices fall, before their income is cut, thus they benefit.footnote:[Theory of Money and Credit, Part 2, Chapter 2, §7, Ludwig von Mises, 1912]

We can observe following law: “When  a  change  in  the  money  relation  causes  prices  to rise, the man whose selling price rises before his buying prices gains, and the man whose buying prices rise first, loses. The one who gains the most from the transition period is the one whose selling price rises first and buying prices last. Conversely, when prices fall,  the  man  whose  buying  prices  fall  before  his  selling price gains, and the man whose selling price falls before his buying prices, loses.”footnote:[Man, Economy and State, Chapter 11, Part 7, Murray N. Rothbard, 1962] The greater and longer the positive difference between the selling and buying prices, the greater the gain. The greater and longer that negative difference, the greater the loss. Which participants gain and loose, depends on the relative time that they receive the newly printed money as it gets diffused throughout the economy.

It has to be noted, that the old and new relative prices and valuation are not identical. Even if the individual valuation would be frozen throughout the adjustment process, the shift in relative prices change the overall demand structure, first for the gainers, later for the losers. The same is the case for the time preference. Even in the helicopter money construct, not all prices will double automatically, because everyone has a unique demand-for-money structure. The exact amount and direction of the shift of the demand structure can of course not be predicted by economists, as they rely solely on the unique individual valuation of countless market participants.footnote:[Theory of Money and Credit, Part 4, Chapter 1, §1, Ludwig von Mises, 1912]

In Bitcoin, there is a set issuance rate for new money units. Initially, 50 new Bitcoins every block can be created and given directly to the miner who finds valid proof of work. Every 210.000 blocks or roughly 4 years, this number is halved, first to 25 Bitcoin, then to 12.5 Bitcoin and eventually, no new Bitcoin will be created in the year 2141 with a total number of just shy of 21 Million Bitcoin in existence. The inflation schedule is part of the Nakamoto Consensus, and therefore it can only be changed if an overwhelming majority individual nodes agree to such a drastic change. As seen in the recent scaling debate, even for a rather trivial change such as the block size security parameter it is nearly impossible to reach consensus. It is safe to say, that such a fundamental change will not be adopted easily and without pushback, if adopted at all. Nakamoto Consensus is verified and enforced by the individual nodes, and noone can coerse the nodes to accept invalid transactions or blocks that change the emission schedule. Even if a fast majority consensus is reached, the minority of nodes cannot be compromised in their individual sovereignty, nobody can force them to change their consensus parameters.

One of the unique attributes of Bitcoin regarding inflation is the difficulty adjustment period of 2016 blocks, where the accumulated proof of work is verified against the targeted time frame of one block every ten minutes. If more hashing power has entered the network over the last two weeks, the difficulty of finding valid PoW is increased; if hashing power has exited the network, the difficulty is decreased. This seems like a trivial procedure, but its effects are very important.

Historically in a money, as more humans use it, the more numbers of transaction possible, the higher its value, the more profitable the production of money, the higher the increase in the stock-to-flow ratio, the lower the value of money, the less people using the money. So the more people use it, the more money is produced, the lower its value. This is true for all types of money previous to Bitcoin.

However, as more people use Bitcoin, the more transactions possible, the higher its value, the more profitable mining, the more miners start hashing. Here’s where the difficulty adjustment kicks in, because with additional hashing power, the difficulty increases. Because the ten minute per block timeframe stays the same, and inflation is tied to the number of blocks, the inflation rate also stays the same. On the contrary to all previous moneys, not the inflation, but the security of the network increases! This leads to even more people using Bitcoin, which starts the cycle all over again. The positive feedback loop increases the security, but leaves the inflation schedule untouched.

“The quantity of Bitcoin created is preprogrammed and cannot be altered no matter how much effort and energy is expended into proof-of-work. […] Difficulty adjustment is the most reliable technology for making hard money and limiting the stock-to-flow ratio from rising, and it makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from every other money. […] Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented: growth in its value cannot possibly increase its supply; it can only make the network more secure and immune to attack. […] Gold became the prime money of every civilized society precisely because it was the hardest to produce, but Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment makes it even harder to produce.”footnote:[Saifedean Ammous 2018, the Bitcoin Standard]

In a fiat system with legal tender laws, inflation is theft because it shifts the purchasing power from the savers, to the money producers, and the users didn’t voluntarily agree to the redistribution and they are forced to use the currency as it depreciates in purchasing power. However, the consensus rules in Bitcoin were set in 2009, and anyone who runs a Bitcoin full node can decide which rules to follow. Any arbitrary change to the open source software is not just possible, but encouraged. Because anyone can adapt the rules, by definition, if an individual node is connecting to the network, it is voluntarily agreeing to the rules in this network, including the inflation schedule. Therefore, the Bitcoin inflation rate is accepted voluntarily, and thus neither coercion nor theft. There is no inherent moral problem with a voluntary inflation, however, there might be an economic issue.
As described earlier, the Cantillon effects favor the money producers over the savers, and shift the purchasing power from one to the other. This creates two problems: (i) malinvestment and (ii) over consumption. 

(i) On the entrepreneur side, because as the quantity of money increases, more money is available for investments and the new money is allocated to rather less profitable and more risky opportunities, which have a potentially greater return, but also a higher chance of default. In a sound economy, the amount of purchasing power dedicated to new investments is dependent on the savings rate of market participants. Thus entrepreneurs might assume that this additional money available for investments comes from consumers who postpone their satisfaction of needs in an uncertain future. In this case it would be profitable for the entrepreneurs to increase the production stages and build higher order goods. However, as in the case of an inflationary money supply, the additional money is not derived from consumer savings, but rather printed out of thin air. Consumers are actually not saving for future consumption, rather they are consuming more in the present.

(ii) On the other hand, consumers have a choice of satisfying their needs right now, or later in the uncertain future. This time preference is unique to each individual, and is evident in the interest rate, which reflects this postponement of gratification. With an increase in the money supply, its price will decrease, incentivizing the immediate exchange for consumption goods. Consumers are thus incentives to postpone saving and increase their current consumption. This behavior is rational in an inflationary economy, but is directly contrary to the expectations of the entrepreneurs. 

Because everyone can become a miner and create blocks, the new money is spread throughout the economy and not to one central party. Thus, no one is the sole beneficiary of the inflated money, which decreases the Cantillon effects. Nevertheless, this economic law is prevalent in Bitcoin as well. The goods subsidised by the inflation are (i) security on the production side and (ii) the block space on the consumption side.

(i) Because of the inflationary block reward, entrepreneurs, in this case the miners, invest more than the users are willing to pay for in mining. There is more hashing power in the network, ceteris paribus, compared to a system without such a block reward. Although one might argue, that the additional mining power and security is beneficial and needed to bootstrap Bitcoin, it nevertheless is a malinvestment. More security is being produced than the individual user is willing to pay for. The logical conclusion is, that the current hyper-exponential growth in Bitcoin's accumulated PoW is not in line with the current needs of users. As soon as the inflation subsidy will decrease, the costs for the security has to be carried by the transaction costs only. It will become evident that the entrepreneurs have produced too much security and that the Bitcoin users are not willing to pay this much directly with transaction fees. Because users will decrease the Satoshi per vWeight transaction inclusion fee, miners will no longer be profitable and can not amortize their investment in mining chips, electricity and know how. These miners who have not anticipated the correct demand for security have over invested and will no longer be profitable.  They will cease operation, which will lower the total hashrate and thus security. The hashrate will continue to drop to that amount which the users are willing to pay for. This correction is inevitable, but due to the difficulty adjustment not a problem for security and block confirmation time. 

(ii) There are costs in securing the Bitcoin network with mining, and those costs are paid for by the individual user with the transaction fee that goes directly to the miner. The more security the users want, the more transaction fees have to be paid. The additional fees will incentivize new miners to start hashing, which will increase the security against reorgs and double spends. However, the payment for the service security is subsidized by the block reward, which gives the miner additionally to the transaction fee the newly inflated Bitcoin. The direct costs for the user, the transaction fees, are thus comparatively low because the miner can pay his production costs in part with the inflated Bitcoin. The block space is thus relatively cheaper for the end user, compared to a network without the inflation. Therefore, users will consume more of the blockchain, i.e. they will make more transactions than they otherwise would. Apps like SatoshiDice will use up block space although the amount of security in the network is way too high for such a use case. SatoshiDice could work perfectly fine in a network with less security, which would increase efficiency at lower costs, for example the lightning network.

"Monopoly  prevents  people  from  using  what  is  rightfully their  property  and  thus  prevents  them  from  competing  with privileged market participants. This is partial theft."footnote:[Hülsmann, Ethics of Money Production, Chapter 9 Legal Monopolies, Part 4  Ethics of Monetary Monopoly] Thus, when there exists a state monopoly on the production of money, it is inherently stealing the private property of entrepreneurs seeking to enter this market and provide a service for their customers. It is theft, regardless if the monopoly entity will inflate the money supply. However, those that have the power to print money, are incentivized misuse this power. In order to prevent this from happening in Bitcoin, anyone can enter the market place to produce new bitcoin by performing PoW through hashing. All that is needed in order to calculate this mathematical function, is a piece of paper and a pen.footnote:[Ken Shirriff, Mining Bitcoin with pencil and paper: 0.67 hashes per day] It is neither required to disclose ones identity, nor use any specific hard ware or ask for permission. Mining is performed by a dynamic set of unknown and untrusted entrepreneurs. Not even Satoshi had extra privilege, as he had to proof his work even for the genesis block. Although he was initially the only miner, he could not exclude anyone from competing agaist him. Precisely because anyone can enter this market place, the inflation evident in Bitcoin is neither unethical nor uneconomical.

Further Paragraphs

The total stock, or supply, of money at any point in time, is the total quantity or weight of the good. In the incumbent Fiat system, there is the central bank money species, and the money substitute, which is used by non-bank participants. Trade between the two moneys is limited to a selected few entities. In the everyday economy, money substitutes are used and classified by liquidity into M1, M2 and M3. The supply of the Fiat money base, that is central bank reserves, is solely dictated by the monopolistic central bank, which unsuccessfully tries to guess the fair quantity.footnote:[David Elton Trueblood, Central Planning and Neomercantilism, 1964] Further, the total money supply, including all types of money substitute, is dependent upon the retail banking sector. Due to a fractional reserve scheme, each deposit can be used as collateral for another loan, but leveraged up with a factor of 100. Effectively, with every additional loan created by retail banks, the money supply increases by 99% of the loan.

With gold, the total supply of money is the weight of gold existing in the economy. There are unknown quantities of unprocessed gold in Earth's crust and in asteroids in the solar system. The supply of gold overground is increased by exploration and mining companies. There are no inherent restrictions upon new entrepreneurs entering the market of producing gold, there is no forceful government monopoly, which allows for true and fair pricing. The true gold money supply is the amount of gold atoms, thus the shape of gold does not matter, the same atoms are in dust, coins or bars.

In Bitcoin, the supply of money is the sum of the nValue field of all UTXOs in the blockchain. The amount and validity is verified by each and every node in the network independently and authoritatively. New UTXOs with new nValue are added with every additional block added to the blockchain, starting with 50 bitcoin per block on January 3rd 2009. After 210.000 valid blocks, or roughly 4 years, this coinbase reward is halved, to 25 BTC in 2012, 12.5 BTC in 2016 and so on. Due to the halving of the mining reward, the supply increases logarithmically and will never surpass 21 million Bitcoin. In 2018 the supply reached above 17 million and the last new coin will be mined in approximately 2141. This issuance schedule was set-up and implemented by Satoshi with the Genesis block and is one vital part of the consensus rules. As every node in the network is verifying and enforcing the consensus rule, the reward schedule is not controlled by any one party and can thus never be changed without overwhelming consensus. The supply of bitcoin is thus determined by true and unchanging mathematical laws and due to the individual enforcement of each node, can not be forcefully changed.
